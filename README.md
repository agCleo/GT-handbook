# GoTriple Content Providers Handbook

## Purpose of this document
[GoTriple](https://www.gotriple.eu/) is a discovery service for the Social Sciences and Humanities community. It is one of the services of the European Research Infrastructure [OPERAS](https://www.operas-eu.org/).   
The GoTriple platform allows to search through publications, datasets, researchers' profiles, and research projects. Publications and datasets metadata are collected from both content aggregators and content providers (see [Glossary](#glossary)).

This handbook is addressed to the **GoTriple content providers**. 
It presents the policies, technical requirements, and supporting actions enabling the providers' content acquisition and processing by the GoTriple platform. It informs them as well about other aggregators' policies.

## GoTriple Policies
### Scope
*Scientific fields*: GoTriple collects metadata of contents in the **Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH)** field. The content providers can be domain specific or not.

*Data definition*: GoTriple only collects **metadata of the contents**. The platform does not collect or store the contents of the providers.

*Geographic area*: GoTriple operates in the **European area** and collects data from European providers. The platform provides enrichments for a limited number of European languages and  collects therefore contents firstly in these languages.

*Openness*: As a service of OPERAS, the RI dedicated to open scholarly communication in the SSH, GoTriple supports **open access** to the contents. The platform however collects open and not open access contents. The metadata of the contents need to be freely accessible and reusable.

*Providers type*: GoTriple providers can be of any size and provide large or small amount of contents in one or many SSH fields. GoTriple works with major aggregators, but also facilitates data acquisition from **small repositories or publishers**, like for instance diamond journals.

*GoTriple supported languages*: Croatian, English, French, German, Greek, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish. 

### Content types
This handbook only considers the data collected about scientific resources. Data about researchers' profiles and research projects are collected through distinct automated processes.   
In GoTriple, the resources are publications and datasets, which are all named "documents".  A **document** is the information asset of a unique and deduplicated resource.
